    <h1>About C.R.</h1>

    <p>C.R. is a rising Senior at Tufts University, double majoring in
       Computer Science and English. They use any pronouns. They are
       originally from Houston, Texas, and they absolutely love it
       there! One of their favorite things to do is to tell people all about
       their hometown.</p>

    <p>C.R. enjoys reading (currently reading
       <span class="book-title">House of Mirth</span> by Edith Wharton), going
       on walks, drinking coffee, and writing letters to their friends.</p>

    <p>C.R. is currently living in New York City for the summer, which has
       made their walks much more exciting! They are in NYC after having only
       visited twice. They're excited to be in a new place
       and considering moving to New York for work after they finish undergrad
       next year! If you have any recommendations for fun things to do in New
       York, please let them know!</p>
